It covers:

Activation Functions: Implementation of common activation functions such as Sigmoid, ReLU, Tanh, and their mathematical representations.
Simple Neural Network from Scratch: Implementation of a basic feedforward neural network without using high-level libraries like TensorFlow or Keras. This includes:
Forward Propagation: Calculating the output of the network.
Backpropagation: Implementing the backpropagation algorithm to update weights and biases.
Training: Training the network on a simple dataset using gradient descent.
Real-World Application: Application of the built neural network to a real-world dataset from Kaggle (e.g., Iris, MNIST, Titanic) to demonstrate its practical usage.
Key Features:

Clear and Concise Code: Well-commented and easy-to-understand Python code for all implementations.
Modular Design: Code is organized into well-defined functions and classes for better readability and maintainability.
Educational Focus: The project is designed to provide a strong foundation in the core concepts of neural networks.
Versatility: The code can be easily adapted and extended for different neural network architectures and datasets.
